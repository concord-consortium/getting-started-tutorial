					<p>Very nice graph! Each point represents one of the cases in your data set.</p>
					<p>The points are scattered randomly for the moment because you haven't
						yet specified how they should be arranged.</p>

				<div>
					<p>Way to go! You dragged the <strong>Date</strong> attribute to the graph's x-axis.</p>
					<p>Now the points have arranged themselves along the axis according to their date.</p>

					<p>Changing the name of a graph can help you keep track of your investigation

						also selected.</p>

				<div>
					<p>You did itâ€”deselecting all cases!</p>
					<p>You can also deslect by clicking in the table's white space.</p>
					<p>Selecting cases is <em>very</em> useful. Deselecting all cases is, too, to

					<p>Fantastic! The six countries show up in the graph's legend. And each country's points

				<div>
					<p>Easy, right? Clicking on a legend symbol not only selects its points, but it also
						brings those points to the front so they aren't covered up by other points.</p>
					<p>You can also click and drag the legend symbols to change their order.</p>

			feedback: (
				<div>
					<p>That's perfect! Hiding cases in a graph is a way to filter out the data you aren't
						interested in for the moment.</p>
					<p>The eyeball menu also has a <em>Show All Cases</em> command to bring back the hidden cases.</p>
					<p>Sometimes you'll want to use the graph's rescale icon (top of panel) so that the points fit nicely in
						the graph.</p>
